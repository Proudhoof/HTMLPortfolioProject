		<h3>Learn More</h3>
		<p>I am a former music student turned frontend developer, having in the last few years discovered the creative joy of web design and programming.
		What started as an interest in designing the visual part of websites with HTML and CSS eventually led to a number of university-level courses
		in both the theoretical and practical aspects of how we use and develop the internet today. At the time of writing I am working on personal projects
		as well as of course constantly trying to broaden my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and whatever else can be used to create awesome websites.</p>
